Please note: The Masonry Shop is not suited for a shop with hundreds of products (in that case use the default shop) but if you only sell a handful of item and want to display them in a stylish way this might be the way to do it. The Masonry Shop has also some limitations that the "default shop" doesn't have. It can't be selected as default shop or shop archive. It is meant to be an extra element on your Frontpage not to display a full fledged shop. Thats what the default shop is for ;)
